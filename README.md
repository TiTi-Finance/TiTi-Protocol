TiTi-Protocol is a new type of elastic supply algorithm stablecoin protocol based on decentralized Monopoly Auto Market Maker mechanism (M-AMM) and backed by Multi-Assets-Reserve. TiTi is the stablecoin issued by the protocol.

## Advantages

* **Open and Transparent:** TiTi Protocol is fully realized through smart contracts on the chain, and the mechanism is open and transparent;

* **High capital efficiency:** Compared with over-collateralized stablecoins, TiTi Protocol has a higher capital efficiency;

* **Stronger stable capability:** TiTi Protocol brings a new type of elastic supply algorithm stablecoin solution that incorporates the Multi-Assets-Reserve mechanism. The stabilization mechanism does not rely too much on the algorithm and is more efficient which ensures that there is sufficient value support behind each TiTi token;

* **Anti-Volatility risk:** By introducing the multi-assets reserve mechanism, the protocol amortizes the risk of individual asset fluctuations, thereby enhancing the risk resistance of the entire system. At the same time, the protocol introduces financial products such as MMF, which creates new game models, to further guarantees the stability of TiTi;

* **Scalability:** The architecture design of TiTi Protocol is easy to expand by introducing new type of reserve and the governance mechanism can effectively improve the protocolâ€™s risk control ability during expansion process;

## Core Innovative

### Monopoly-AMM

This is a new design paradigm for algorithmic stablecoins. It is responsible for capturing the real-time supply and demand relationship of TiTi and dynamically adjusting the circulation of TiTi.

### ReOrders

This is the core mechanism for controlling TiTi's price to remain stable in TiTi Protocol. It is built on CFMM, which greatly reduces gas consumption while realize price stability with utmost efficiency.

### Market Maker Fund

A decentralized fund product designed by TiTi Protocol to enhance the protocol's ability to resist volatility risks by introducing the gaming relationship among the algorithmic stablecoin stakeholders.

### Multi-Assets-Reserve Portfolio

In TiTi Protocol, reserves are composed of a variety of funds. TiTi Protocol adjusts the composition of reserve assets through community governance to enhance risk resistance.
